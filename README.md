# Boosting Conversion & Revenue in Underperforming Urban Food Courts

This consulting project addresses a real-world problem faced by a major real estate group operating 25+ food courts across Indian Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities. Despite malls recovering nearly 90% of pre-COVID footfall, food court sales remain low—especially in Tier-2 cities. The objective was to understand why mall visitors are not converting into food court customers and to propose actionable, low-cost strategies to improve conversion, average order value (AOV), and overall revenue within 60 days.

Through funnel analysis, issue tree breakdown, and customer segmentation, the root causes were identified: poor stall visibility, limited food options, high wait times, lack of digital ordering, and weak promotions. Three targeted solutions were designed: (1) queue management and QR-based ordering to reduce wait times, (2) combo meals and flash deals to drive higher AOV, and (3) VIP Foodie Pass with SMS/email marketing to boost retention. Each solution included a pilot plan with budget, KPIs, and expected revenue uplift ranging from ₹2L to ₹29L per month.

The proposed strategies are designed for fast rollout, minimal investment, and measurable impact, making them suitable for expansion across Tier-2 malls.
